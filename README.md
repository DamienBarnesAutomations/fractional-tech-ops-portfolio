# 🇮🇪 Fractional Tech Ops Portfolio: Automation & Reporting for SMEs

This repository documents the foundational learning journey and practical application of systems and automation for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with a focus on businesses in the Irish midlands.

My goal is to provide reliable, low-maintenance technology operations solutions, enabling business owners to focus on growth instead of manual data entry and repetitive tasks.
